            These nuclear reactors make up 15% of Canada's energy production and
            have international usage in countries like Pakistan, India, and
            Romania. The reactor uses natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as
            a moderator. What makes the CANDU unique is how it can reuse fuel

              Uranium has three naturally occurring isotopes, uranium-238,
              uranium-235 and uranium-234. Uranium-238 makes up 99.3% of natural
              uranium, while uranium-235 makes up 0.7%. There have been many
              concerns regarding uranium extraction facilities because they
              produce radiation. In fact, uranium decays to radium, which then
              decays to the radioactive gas. The two primary methods of natural
              uranium extraction include open-pit mining and situ-leaching, both
              producing radioactive waste.

              The radiation that Uranium emits is ionizing radiation since it is
              a radionuclide. Radionuclides are unstable elements that emit
              radiation, and these elementsâ€™ atoms release ionizing radiation in
              the form of electromagnetic waves. Although there are many natural
              forms of ionizing radiation that we are exposed to every day (e.g.
              soil), repetitive exposure to artificial sources of ionizing
              radiation can end up causing external and internal damage to our
              bodies. When water is exposed to ionizing radiation, it undergoes
              a process called radiolysis, and this has been found to damage the
              cells of dna.

              used light water as moderators, but the use of heavy water is more
              efficient because heavy water is made up of deuterium isotopes,
              which make it so any excess neutrons are not absorbed, resulting

          Uranium fuel is considered a waste material when it can no longer
          produce heat or energy. The products of the fission reaction occurring
          in the reactor include the isotopes cesium-137 and strontium-90, which
          account for the heat and radioactivity in the waste. Fuel bundles are
          first put into pools filled with water to reduce their heat and
          radioactivity for 7-10 years. This initial step of storage is called
          <span className="text-grey-teal font-semibold"> wet storage</span>. After this period, they are taken out of the pools and
          stored in containers reinforced with high-density concrete and steel.
          These containers help keep the radiation from getting out, while
          keeping the chemical toxicity of the fuel bundles inside. This process is called <span className="text-grey-teal font-semibold">dry storage</span>, and fuel bundles can
          stay in these containers for a minimum of 50 years, but these bundles
          can continue to remain in the containers for longer, given that they
          are being adequately maintained. Waste from the CANDU is most commonly
          put through geological disposal, which involves placing fuel bundles
          in a sediment rock and setting them hundreds of metres from the
          earth's surface.
